# British-Informatics-Olympiad
These are my solution to the British informatics olympiad round 1 questions, from 2012 to 2021.

For each question I have attempted to comment most of my code, to try to explain my thought process.
Most of my answers are written in python, but there are a few that are written in cpp. I am currently working on making all the solutions in python.

I hope that this may help some people that were looking for solutions as there are no official solutions.
Also, the example solutions that you may see in the folders are from others such as:
